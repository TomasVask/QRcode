## Overview
First challenge of frontendmentor.io - creating a QR code card.
### Screenshot

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Vertical alignment is still not clear. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.container {
    height: 500px;
    width: 320px;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    display: flex;
    flex-flow: column wrap;
    align-items: center;
    border-radius: 20px;
    margin: 10vh auto;
    box-shadow: 5px 5px 15px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.055);
```

### Continued development

Will focus on layouts, flexbox specificities as well as positioning which I still find confusing.
